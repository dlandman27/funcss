# Refactor Site

Overhaul an existing site — rename it, rewrite the page, recategorize it — and keep
the catalog in sync. Use when a site's catalog entry doesn't match what the page
actually does, when a page needs a redesign, or during a site-by-site cleanup pass.

## Usage
`/refactor-site <folder-name> [what to change]`

Example: `/refactor-site prefixsuffix rename to "The Longest Name" and make the name buildable`

---

## What to do

1. **Read the current state first.** Read `sites/<folder-name>/index.html` AND the
   site's entry in `catalog.json`. Compare them — the most common problem is a catalog
   name/description that doesn't match what the page actually does. Report the mismatch
   to the user before changing anything if they haven't already described the change.

2. **Update the catalog entry** in `catalog.json` (never edit `index.html` at the repo
   root by hand — it is generated):
   - `name` and `description` must describe what the page ACTUALLY does after the refactor
   - `section` must fit the new content: `educational`, `fun`, `tools`, `games`,
     `entertainment`, `mindfulness`, `art`
   - Keep the `slug` unchanged — it is the folder name and the live URL; renaming the
     site does NOT mean renaming the folder
   - `random: true` only if the site works with zero instructions when a visitor lands
     on it cold

3. **Rewrite the page** at `sites/<folder-name>/index.html`, following the same rules
   as `/new-site`:
   - First tag in `<head>` must be: `<script defer src="https://randomsitesontheweb.com/globals/global.js"></script>`
     (older sites are missing it — always add it during a refactor)
   - Include `<meta charset="UTF-8">` and `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
   - `<title>` must match the new catalog `name`
   - Vanilla HTML + CSS + JS only, fully self-contained in one file, no CDN imports
   - Responsive — must look good on mobile
   - **Read `.claude/commands/site-style.md` first and follow it** — the sticker-comic design
     language, interaction feel, voice, and tech checklist for every site
   - Prefer interactive over static — if the old page was a wall of text, give it a toy

4. **Run `npm run build`** — regenerates `index.html` from the catalog and validates
   the entry.

5. **Verify**: grep the generated `index.html` for the new name to confirm the card
   updated, and open `sites/<folder-name>/index.html` in a browser (or ask the user to)
   to confirm the page works.

6. **Tell the user** what changed: old name → new name, section moves, and what the
   page now does.
